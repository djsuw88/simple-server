Simple Server
=============

This is a fork of simpleframework 6.0.1:

[http://www.simpleframework.org/](http://www.simpleframework.org/)

The only purpose of this fork is to make it easier to replace the
built in thread pools with user supplied executors to provide a bit
better control over thread usage.  At the time of writing, simpleframework
hasn't been updated in years so I simply made these changes in a fork
for the sake of convenience.  I strongly encourage you to check out
simpleframework and the excellent work done by ngallagher!
